# Moonlight

Hello!! I'm Kyra (or Skycloudd, or Starlight) and this is the place where I upload blog posts I write for fun! :D

This place is a little empty for now, but hopefully that will change soon!!

A bit about me: I'm a 19 year old girl from the Netherlands studying software engineering. In my free time I write compilers and sometimes play video games.
